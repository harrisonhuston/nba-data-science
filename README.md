# NBA Data Science

  The NBA Data Science Project uses data analysis and machine learning to analyze player statistics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and predict player total 
  points scored. The program takes CSV files of player statistics over a ten season timeframe and analyzes and charts player statistics, as well as predicts total points 
  scored. The project utilizes Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Linear and Quadratic Regressions, Decision Trees, and Random Forests within Python.

  Please see the instructions word document (instructions.docx) for instructions on how to run the program.
